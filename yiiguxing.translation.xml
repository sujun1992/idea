      <item value="Defines property resolution behavior on objects using the JavaBeans component architecture. This * resolver handles base objects of any type, as long as the base is not null.

The value is accessed using JavaBeans getters and setters. This * resolver can be constructed in read-only mode, which means that isReadOnly will always return * true and {@link #setValue(ELContext, Object, Object, Object)} will always throw * PropertyNotWritableException. ELResolvers are combined together using {@link CompositeELResolver} * s, to define rich semantics for evaluating an expression. See the javadocs for {@link ELResolver} * for details. Because this resolver handles base objects of any type, it should be placed near the * end of a composite resolver. Otherwise, it will claim to have resolved a property before any * resolvers that come after it get a chance to test if they can do so as well." />
