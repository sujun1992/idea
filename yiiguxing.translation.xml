The caller must request * one of the pre-defined module types or an error will be returned. Within the * catalog, each VF Module references (among other things) a cloud template * which is used to deploy the required artifacts (VMs, networks, etc.) * to the cloud. In this adapter implementation, that artifact is expected * to be a Cloudify blueprint. * * Depending on the blueprint, a variable set of input parameters will * be defined, some of which are required. The caller is responsible to * pass the necessary input data for the module or an error will be thrown. * * The method returns the vfModuleId, a Map of output attributes, and a VnfRollback * object. This last object can be passed as-is to the rollbackVnf operation to * undo everything that was created for the Module.
